# react-exercises
Short exercises that may change or evolve as I am bettering my ReactJS skills. 

I will add or delete exercises as my practice will further. This is purely for personal practice and for showing some examples to those who may be advancing their knowledge of ReactJS as well. 

Note: In the Musicard Game the age for each instrument is a guess or a proximation of the date it was invented. They are not teh instruments' exact ages.
